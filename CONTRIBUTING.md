# Contributing

First of all, many thanks for considering making a contribution to this project.

## Configs

The main thing we need is config files which control the process of which files are processed by a particular set of templates. Testing
the generated code is also extremely valuable.

## New templates

In the first instance, templates should be submitted to the parent [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) 
project. If this is not possible, new templates can be added here first.
